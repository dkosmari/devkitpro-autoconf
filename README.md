# Devkitpro Autoconf

This is a collection of Autoconf macros to make it easier to use the devkitPro toolchain.

The macros all use the [all-permissive
license](https://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html_node/License-Notices-for-Other-Files.html). They
depend on [Autoconf Archive](https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf-archive/) macros, which
are usually installed alongside base Autoconf.
