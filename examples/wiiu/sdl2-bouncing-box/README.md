# SDL2 Bouncing Box example for the Wii U

This example shows how to build a SDL2 application for the Wii U. It also creates a "wuhb"
bundle, with an audio file.


## Build instructions

1. `./bootstrap`

2. `./configure --host=powerpc-eabi`

3. `make`

4. (Optional) `make run`


## Explanation

### [`bootstrap`](bootstrap)

The `bootstrap` script makes sure the macros are available without needing them to be
installed in the system.


### [`configure.ac`](configure.ac)

The first step is to call `DEVKITPRO_WUT_INIT` to ensure the paths are all set up for
cross compilation.

Later, we call `DEVKITPRO_WUT_SETUP` to ensure all compilation flags are set up for WUT.

`SDL2` and `SDL2_mixer` are queried using `pkg-config`, using the `PKG_CHECK_MODULES`.


### [`Makefile.am`](Makefile.am)

Since we have extra flags created by `PKG_CHECK_MODULES`, we need to incorporate them in
our build. The easiest way to do it is using `AM_CPPFLAGS` and `LDADD`.

We define a rule for creating the `.wuhb` file, from the `.rpx` file, and make sure the
`all-local:` target builds the `.wuhb`.

For convenience, we can create a `run:` target, that uses `wiiload` to run the program on
a Wii U console named `wiiu` on the network.

The recipe that converts `.elf` into `.rpx` is generated by the `configure` script, inside
`aminclude.am`. We import those recipes using the `@INC_AMINCLUDE@` line.
